                "C DOT's GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) technology offers an excellent mix of triple play services (voice, data & video) to end users. This is an indigenous development of C DOT and offers advantages in terms of appropriateness for Indian environment, Innovation & local manufacturing.  <br>    <br>  GPON has only passive components in the neighbourhood infrastructure while active electronics are deployed only in the main communication room/Central Office and at the customer’s desk/workstations. At the central office, the termination point is Optical Line Terminal (OLT) equipment. At the customer premises, the termination point is in optical network terminals or ONTs. Between the OLT and the ONT is the passive optical network comprising of fibre links and passive splitters. In GPON, optical fibre can be split to support multiple CPEs and reaches to each user/room. Because multiple users share the optical fibre and Central Office equipment (OLT), GPON substantially reduces the investment required to serve a given number of users. C DOT's EMS/LCT complements GPON solution with the ease of provisioning, monitoring and management of complete network and its elements.  <br>    <br>  Current technology delivers a downstream data rate of 2.5 Gbps and an upstream data rate of 1.25 Gbps on a single fibre over a distance of up to 60 Kms. One optical fibre from OLT can be shared with up to 128 users. Signals from the OLT to the ONT are encrypted (secure) and then broadcasted to workstation devices. Signals from the workstation devices are then multiplexed back to the OLT."

The security of the QKD system is guaranteed by the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, and any attempt of eavesdropping during key generation and distribution causes detectable anomalies.  <br>  C DOT’s QKD solution consists of two nodes, conventionally called Alice (QKD transmitter) and Bob (QKD receiver), connected through a unidirectional quantum channel (for transmitting qubits from Alice to Bob) and a bidirectional classical channel (for synchronization and post processing).

O RAN compliant 5G RAN mainly consists of O CU, O DU and O RU modules which are developed in C DOT. Management and configuration of these modules are done by local Element Management System (EMS).  <br>  O CU/O DU software stack which is 3GPP compliant supports TDD and FDD mode and upto 100MHz bandwidth. It also supports major features like up to 128 RRC connected users, MIMO, O RAN Fronthaul interface, etc. These modules are successfully integrated with in house developed C DOT O RU module as well as third party radio modules like VVDN and tested the gNodeB functionalities.   <br>  O RU is designed and developed indigenously in C DOT. O RU is designed to operate in N78 Band (TDD). It supports configurable bandwidths from 10MHz to 100MHz which is not a common feature in O RUs available in the market. It supports 4T4R MIMO configuration and it can be upgradable to 8T8R. This O RU is integrated with in house developed O CU/O DU modules and third party O CU/O DU modules available in the market.  <br>  These O RAN compliant (O CU, O DU and O RU) modules are integrated and standalone gNodeB functionalities are evaluated with test instruments.

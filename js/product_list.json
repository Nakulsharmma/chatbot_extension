      "describe": "C-DOT's GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) technology offers an excellent mix of triple play services (voice, data & video) to end users. This is an indigenous development of C-DOT and offers advantages in terms of appropriateness for Indian environment, Innovation & local manufacturing.\r\n\r\nGPON has only passive components in the neighbourhood infrastructure while active electronics are deployed only in the main communication room/Central Office and at the customer’s desk/workstations. At the central office, the termination point is Optical Line Terminal (OLT) equipment. At the customer premises, the termination point is in optical network terminals or ONTs. Between the OLT and the ONT is the passive optical network comprising of fibre links and passive splitters. In GPON, optical fibre can be split to support multiple CPEs and reaches to each user/room. Because multiple users share the optical fibre and Central Office equipment (OLT), GPON substantially reduces the investment required to serve a given number of users. C-DOT's EMS/LCT complements GPON solution with the ease of provisioning, monitoring and management of complete network and its elements.\r\n\r\nCurrent technology delivers a downstream data rate of 2.5 Gbps and an upstream data rate of 1.25 Gbps on a single fibre over a distance of up to 60 Kms. One optical fibre from OLT can be shared with up to 128 users. Signals from the OLT to the ONT are encrypted (secure) and then broadcasted to workstation devices. Signals from the workstation devices are then multiplexed back to the OLT.",
